* If you click on a recipe (like "Original Mongolian Chicken" for example), it will send you to a page with similar details to what we can see when we want to add a recipe (i.e. recipe name, recipe description, nutritional or other details, ingredients, steps, and difficulty). We can also see the rating of the recipe in the form of stars. There are some actions that any user can do (even without being logged in) like the following:
  * Navigate to the user who created this recipe by clicking on their username
  * Change the servings for the recipe to adjust the ingredients needed

 * However, this page, also include several other actions that you can do only logged-in as a user:
   * You may fork the recipe. In other words, you can create a copy of the recipe and add your own spin to it. A timeline will be shown to demonstrate the fork history for users to view. This fork history is rendered as a list and you can see an example for the recipe "Slow Cooker Philadelphia Pulled Pork Roll".

* The user also has the option to delete any of the recipes they have made
* Each user also has a functional progress bar that measures their skill level. Their progress is measured by the number of recipes they have made. The progress will fill {number of recipes made by user}/100 of the progress bar or will completely fill the progress bar if the number of recipes made by user is greater than or equal to 100. Here are the skill levels that could be assigned to a user:
  * Beginner: The number of recipes made by the user is between 0 and 10 inclusive

# The role of users
The core of the web application are the recipes. Users are able to search for recipes according
to name, cuisine, or even ingredients. These recipes include a list of ingredients with their
desired quantities, recipe calorie count, nutritional information of the dish, and a step-by-step
guide on how to make the dish. Advanced cooks can share recipes and teach cooking methods
with friends and strangers alike, while newer cooks can follow along their recipes while learning
how to perform basic cooking tasks such as mincing garlic and chopping vegetables. Cooks can
also create “forks” of existing recipes to include improvements in ingredients, seasonings, or
even entire steps. Lastly, users are able to vote for the recipes that they think are best, as well
as leave feedback and comments.
